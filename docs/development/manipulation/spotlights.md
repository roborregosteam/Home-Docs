    - Massive improvements on speed, obtained from collision object generation, reducing use of octomap and collision meshes and tuning GPD estimated grasp poses
    - Planning times in comparison:
        - Original MoveIt Pipeline (TMR2023, TDP2024): >1 minute
        - Cartesian Planning (no collision detection, inferior working distance) (TMR2024, Robocup2024): ~20s
        - New Moveit Pipeline (TMR2025): ~10s
    - Octomap integrated within perception pipeline, enabling very safe pick and place operations
    - Integrated on subtask manager for GPSR and Storing Groceries
- New URDF for Simulation and Real robot
    - Fixed for use on simulation
    - Fixed a big issue which caused the pointcloud to be shifted ~3cm from its real position
- Give & take operations for task manager
- Improved face follower
- Documentation and new easy to use launches for pick & place pipeline

### In Progress
- Robot still has issues picking big objects
- Storing Groceries task involves placing on a difficult surface and at a high risk of colliding, which requires further testing
- Plane extraction to generate a collision object for the table requires tuning to be working on a wider range of scenarios

### News
- No news

### Done
- Added simulation with real robot's ZED camera and gripper, working with 2D and 3D camera
- Fixed transform time issues when deploying some scripts on simulation e.g. object detector.
- Integrated the full pick pipeline with object detector 2D on simulation. Refactored the code to make it easier to use and to scale better for new tasks.
- Tested pipeline on real robot with ZED camera
    - Once again, sim-to-real was smooth without any logic changes
    - Adjustements were made so all our heavy topics use "Best Effort" QoS policy which made real-robot tests possible -> receiving images and pointclouds through WiFi.
    - Robot was not able to pick the object as some URDF changes are yet to be added.
- Face follow tested and working.
- New poses for Carry my Luggage and Receptionist

### In Progress
- CuRobo environment setup
- Three issues were detected on Receptionist runs:
    - Sometimes, planning hangs on the custom planning_server, not detecting planning failed and not returning a result.
    - GetJoints service may return all 0s.
    - MoveIt did not notics position all 0s as invalid even when it's on collision
- Place pipeline with all services added.
- URDF QoL changes.

### News
- No news

### Done
- Cleaned up task manager, got some remaining things ready for receptionist
- Fixed an issue where collision objects were collising among themselves
- Heatmap for getting place position

### In Progress
- CuRobo worked on PCs, environment on the Orin is not ready yet.
- List of GPDs ready, some already tested and discarded (SamsungLabs)
    - Reason: Picks on unusable poses e.g. below the object, and has no way of taking as input the characteristics of the gripper.
- Advances on the placing object pipeline.

### Notes
- Slow week but the @Home manipulation team is known for rising from the ashes like a phoenix.

### News
- First pick of the year

### Done
- Succesful tests on simulation and real life ---> not a line of code modified on sim2real
- GPD connection to ROS2
- 2D Detection handler to ease use of 2d object detection
- Documentation on running pick and place methods and all nodes necessary for receptionist

Pick on Simulation:

### In Progress
- Planning of the next phase of the project:
    - New motion planning methods
    - Accelerating 3D perception
    - Constrained Planning
    - Task-specific work
- Place methods and tests 
- Accelerating perception 3D methods
- Looking for new GPDs

### Notes
- Our additions to the pick pipeline show a SIGNIFICANT improvement in planning time, from several minutes to less than 10 seconds. 
- We will begin the SOTA phase to improve all areas of the pipeline:
    - Faster Motion planning
    - Optimized Motion Planning
    - Better GPDs

## 2025-03-20
This includes both weeks from 2025-03-07 to 2025-03-20

### News
- We got early results on the March 15th demo. 

### Done
- Pick server, which handles all motion planning to pick objects
- Manipulation Core, that communicates with detector, GPD and pick server
- Manipulation Server, which communicates external systems e.g. task manager, with the manipulation core
- Object detector 2D with 3D point extraction
- Object 3D extraction -> Clustering and mesh reconstruction
    - We added a new method to accelerate planning by reconstructing the table as a box and the object as a set of spheres instead of a mesh
- Gazebo simulation and moveit config seem to be all ready to use
- Octomap working now on ZED input
- Pick using 3D object extraction and pick server
 
### In Progress
- Grasping pose detection connection to ROS2
- Service to handle updating recent detections to avoid subscribers on many nodes
- Integration of detection and GPD on Manipulation Core
- Planning of the next phase of the project:
    - New motion planning methods
    - Accelerating 3D perception
    - Constrained Planning
    - Task-specific work 

### Notes
- Moveit2 seems to have no real benefits over Moveit1 apart from the constrained planning feature. We expect other changes, such as the primitive object reconstruction to solve old planning time issues.
- All code so far has not been migrated to ROS2 from its version on home-manipulation, but reworked and replanned for better maintainability and flexibility.
